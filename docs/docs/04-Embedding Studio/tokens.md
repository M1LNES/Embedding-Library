Previewing is possible only if the tokens are valid - tokens are store in localstorage and you can create them by two buttons located in footer.

## Creating Public API Token

For Public API Token, you must be connected to `suite account`. After clicking on the button, you will be redirected to page where you just allow the permissions. After that, token will be saved in your localstorage and the button should dissapear and ✅ appear.

## Creating Omni Studio Token

For Public API Token, you must be connected to `VPN`. After clicking on the button, you will be redirected to page where you again just allow the permissions. After that, token will be saved in your localstorage and the button should dissapear and ✅ appear.

## Previewing

If both tokens were successfuly created, the disabled button for previwing should be now enabled and you can start previewing widget visualizations!
